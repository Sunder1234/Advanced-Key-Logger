Overview
This repository contains an advanced keylogger developed in Python. Unlike traditional keyloggers, this keylogger offers a comprehensive set of features, including keystroke logging, screenshot capture, audio recording, and clipboard monitoring. It operates stealthily in the background, providing a powerful tool for monitoring and surveillance purposes.

Features

Keystroke Logging: Captures keystrokes from the target system, including special keys such as function keys and modifiers like Shift and Ctrl.
Screenshot Capture: Takes periodic screenshots of the target system's desktop, providing visual context alongside keystroke logs.
Audio Recording: Optionally records audio from the target system's microphone, allowing for comprehensive monitoring.
Clipboard Monitoring: Tracks changes to the clipboard content, capturing copied text and other data.
Stealth Mode: Operates silently in the background, without the user's knowledge or awareness.
Encrypted Logging: Optionally, log files can be encrypted for enhanced security.
Scheduled Tasks: Configure the keylogger to run at specific times or intervals for targeted monitoring.
Remote Access: Retrieve logs and captured media remotely via email or other secure channels.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
